{"corpus": [{"docNum": 0,"text": "The  'otherness' of Othello, when compared to the other tragedies, doesn't just stem from the fact that it features Shakespeare's only (and English drama's first) black hero. In Macbeth and King Lear, Shakespeare would go on to use the rugged bleakness of ancient Britain to depict scheming kings bringing about their own fall. But the decadence of Venice, where women let heaven see the pranks/they dare not show their husbands, and Cyprus, where the beguiling Turks prepare a couch of war, help to establish Othello as a tragedy of passion, in which a man is torn apart by the terrifying intensity of his relationships with his lover, his enemies and society as a whole."}, {"docNum": 1,"text": "Probably written and performed in late 1604, Shakespeare took the story of a Moorish warlord moved to a state of murderous jealousy by his ensign from Cinthio's Hecatommithi. While Cinthio's story is relentlessly brutal, with Othello finally bludgeoning his wife Disdemona with a sandbag before being killed by her relatives, Shakespeare gives his a near-erotic level of intimacy â€“ Othello smothers Desdemona in bed, before turning his sword on himself when his mistake is revealed."}]}
